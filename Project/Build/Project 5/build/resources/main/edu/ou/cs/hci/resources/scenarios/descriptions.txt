Alex has finally been able to sneak away onto her maid’s laptop for 15 minutes while she is off polishing macaroon-shaped vases. She saw her maid browsing pictures of cute doggos earlier in the week, and so she wants to open the same application her maid used (Proud Puppies) to look at all the cute doggos and be overwhelmed with love and affection for them. Alex will want to scroll through as many images as she can within her limited 15 minutes of freedom, but because she has had little technological experience, she will struggle if the pathway to navigating the application is not robust and easily identifiable. She knows that doggos come in many shapes and sizes, and wants to see as many different kind of cute, fluffy, adorable doggos in the little time she has. The order in which the dogs are presented to her does not matter, just that she sees as many different kinds of doggos as possible.
Jorje is distraught over how he has neglected his children, even though he plans on it only being temporary. In order to keep them happy and occupied, he wants to find a doggo that will be adventurous and keep up with their large amounts of energy. Because he knows so little about dogs and the differences in breed, Jorje will want to explore the energy and responsibility levels that come with certain dogs, in order to find the perfect fit for his children/family. He wants to use proud puppies in order to find doggos that are up for adoption in his local area, and he wants to be able to quickly look at their age, breed, name, etc.
After surviving a harrowing escapade of death and destruction, John Wick is looking to find another dog to replace the one he lost. He’s not very picky as far as breed, size, etc., but he does want to personally meet the dog in order to bond with it. John will want to use Proud Puppies to quickly peruse the selection of local doggos available for adoption, as he’s not a very indecisive man. He is a patient man, but will grow tired of clunky UI and possibly start shooting his computer because he’s kind of got some repressed rage since his wife died and a russian rich boy punk killed the only thing he held dear in this world since her death.
