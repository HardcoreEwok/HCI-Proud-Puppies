Julia Peters – Female – Age 32Julia is a stay at home mom of 2 kids (both under 10 years) with a highest education level of high school. Her and her family live in the outskirts of Dallas, TX. She enjoys long bubble baths and regular brunch with her girlfriends. Her husband works full time and is usually not home before 6pm but that’s okay because she enjoys getting time alone while the kids are at school then getting some time just with her kids before the hubs gets home. She has recently decided to go back to school and pursue a college degree in education! Her hobbies include running a “Wine and Spine” book club that meets every weekend, and staying up-to-date with all the top ranked, mommy-fashion, bloggers. Julia is a nice woman, but can occasionally display a hot temper when pushed enough.
Brady Johnson – Male – Age 19Brady is a freshman BYX pledge at the University of Arkansas who loves to jet ski and go camping. He is in his second semester and has not declared a major yet. What he has declared is that Apple is going to rule the world and he refuses to use any technology from another brand if Apple has a product for it. In his pastime, he hangs out with the bros, attends the College Group bible study with the on-campus ministry, and works out to make up for how much junk he’s been eating since going to Uni (blame the meal plan he says). Brady has an easy-going demeanor and seems to always make friends with everyone. He has become quite the heartthrob of the freshman class at his college despite the fact that he has never been on a date in his life.
