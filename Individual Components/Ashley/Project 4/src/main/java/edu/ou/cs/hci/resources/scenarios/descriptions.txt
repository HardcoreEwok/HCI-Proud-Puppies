Julia and her family have agreed that they need a pet! Before deciding which pet to get, Julia wants to research what types of pets other families have and find out what kind of care they will require! She wants a pet that will not be high maintenance, is good with young children, and will hopefully live for the entire time that her kids are in primary school (~10 years from now). They also need a pet that will be able to be comfortable in the sometimes very high temperatures of TX, and won’t be hard to find boarding for when they take their week-long vacation every year. She interested in seeing what kinds of pets have been adopted in the areas around them.
Brady is doing some research for his ENGL 2000 level, writing class. He has chosen to write an informative essay about the most common pets in the US. He needs to be able to gather information about what the 10 pets to adopt are, where in the US those pets have the highest adoption rate, average size of that type of animal, and he’s hoping to find some other fun fact to mention, possibly something like “craziest trick known by a pet”, etc. Brady has been doing poorly in this class though, so he needs to get a stellar grade on this paper to put him back on track to hopefully be able to pull off a B in this course.
Steven was talking to Joe, a co-worker, who just adopted a new animal! Joe showed Steven how he could see his new pet through this listing service. Steven ended up loving looking through at all the pets that have been adopted! His favorite is when he see’s pictures of pets dressed in funny costumes. He now finds himself scrolling through the lists trying to find the most exotic animal, or the tiniest animal, etc. It helps pass time while he’s on the public commute and frequently when he’s pooping.
