My program implements the design reformat discussed in the group assignment where we
moved the preview windows to the right of the main window/display. In the mock up for 
the relocation, the windows were fairly small, and I felt that they should be bigger 
in order for them to be discernible previews. If a user wants to see other images,
they should be able to distinguish the general structure/layout of the image just from
a glance, and I felt like the sizes we had before were too small when implemented,
so I opted for larger windows. The main display was made more square to resemble the 
preview windows so users can visually link their functional similarities by their shape.

For color, I implemented exactly what the group design stated. Making the buttons be the 
darker Cello color with the Porcelain text really helps distinguish them from all the
other widgets, while the universal background color of Havelock Blue acts as a good 
neutral base against the other blue hues we used throughout. Each widget that had text
in it was made to have a Porcelain background color, while the text was changed to
use the darker Cello color. The Cello color for the text fits well as it's practically
indistinguishable from black default color, but still holds to our theme of 4 colors.
Lastly, we used Viking as the color for selection highlight, and it's enough of a shift
from the main neutral Havelock Blue to not look off while still providing necessary 
contrast.

For text/labeling, we went with a universal shift to the Tahoma font. I had originally
made the font 12 point, but this made some text on the buttons get cut off, so I
switched it to 11 point. All text across the entire Swing project is changed, including
widget, label, and menu text.
