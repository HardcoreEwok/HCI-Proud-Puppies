Alexia von Eidenweiss, who prefers the name Alex, is a 15 year old girl and heir to her father’s Swedish macaroon empire. She is pampered and treated like the heiress she is, but she longs for independence and the life of a normal girl. Alexia has little experience with technology as her father disdains it, and because she is waited on hand-and-foot, she lacks proper experience with many objects which are technologically commonplace such as phones, computers, etc. Being homeschooled, she has had little social interaction with children her own age outside of the other heirs and heiresses of Swedish nut-based empires. The only thing she has ever begged her pupah for is a cute doggo, but he refuses to get her one out of repressed anguish he holds for his dog Fido who was taken from him much too soon when he was a wee lad.
Jorje-Garcia-Romero Smith is an accountant at a fortune 500 company. He works long shifts because the bosses rely on him to get accounting-ish things done fast, because they’re important, because money. By the time Jorje gets home, he is exhausted and just wants to see his 3 children to perk up his mood. Alas, because he’s so important at his company, he works long hours and most often arrives home after the children are already in bed. His children are aged 3, 6, and 7 years old, and love to adventure and play around the house and yard. Jorje feels bad about always coming home so late, but he is holding out at his job for now so that he can get a promotion and be shifted to more reasonable hours so that he can see his children more, but that is still a long way away. Jorje has little knowledge of dogs and breeds as he never had a pet when he was younger.
