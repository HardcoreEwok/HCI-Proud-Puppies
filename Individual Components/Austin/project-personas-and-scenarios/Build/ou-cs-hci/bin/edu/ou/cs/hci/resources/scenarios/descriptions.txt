Margret is looking for an application that is very user friendly, because she is not good with technology. She wants the app to be straight forward and does exactly what it says it will do. She wants to use such an app to get a good idea what kind of cat she would like to buy, and possibly maybe another animal. Since she has a lot of free time she would use this app whenever she felt bored or the need to look at cats. Her house would be the place that she would use this app. 
Jose wants an application that gives him general information about all sorts of animals. Because of his family's financial situation, he only has an old smart phone, which is his mothers. He wants an app that is compatible with older phones, but still runs smoothly. Jose would use this app when he would be driving with his mother and running errands with her. Even during his downtime at his house would be a time of usage. Since he is interested in all sorts of animals he would like to sort the animals by types. This is so he can look at animals that he want to research that day. 
Adal's curiosity for animals has him wanting an app that allows him to look at different countries animals. Since he travels to many different places he would like this app to be able to translate different languages to a language he know. This is so he can read about local people's pets and how they see their pets. He would mostly use this while in airports waiting to get on or off his plane. Since he is on plane so much he would like to be able to save some searches and look through them offline. Maybe even save some of his favorite searches from other countries to look at later.
