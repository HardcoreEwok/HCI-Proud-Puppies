For the sketch I wanted there to be limited space between each component. This was to shorten the distance the user had to travel to get to different components. I wanted to make it simple also. I felt like that too much fancy components were unnecessary and unwanted. Both windows are centered based on the position of the main window. Once we have metadata on the animals, the filter would output the results in the left most panel under the buttons. 
For the actual design, there is more space in between components than I would have liked. The GridBagLayout is complex and difficult to work with. Hopefully someone can enlighten me on how to fix this issue. However, the windows are centered, and their components are simple. For our guidelines I did not follow that each ComboBox needed to be the same length. This is because it will limit each category differently.
