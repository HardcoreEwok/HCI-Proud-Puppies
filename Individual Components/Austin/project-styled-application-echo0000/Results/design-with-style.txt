I think I did a good job on representing what the team wanted. There were somethings that I could not figure out. One was the toolbar. There was an outline that was not the color we wanted. It looked to be the default color of a menu bar, but I wanted it to be the dark blue color. Another thing was the layout change. I could not get the "Picture slots" on the right side of the display to look good with a regular panel. So, I just used buttons as placeholders. However, all the colors are the ones we picked out and look good.
